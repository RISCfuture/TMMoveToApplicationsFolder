h1. TMMoveToApplicationsFolder

Gives a Cocoa application the ability to move itself to the Applications folder
if it's launched from a different folder.

h2. Usage

Place <tt>TMMoveToApplicationsFolder.h</tt> and
<tt>TMMoveToApplicationsFolder.m</tt> inside a source directory in your Xcode
project. Add them to your project.

In your application delegate, be sure to
@#include <TMMoveToApplicationsFolder.h>@, then call

<pre><code>
[[TMMoveToApplicationsFolder applicationMover] checkApplicationFolder];
</code></pre>

in a method that is executed when the application is started.

This method will handle all aspects of the application-move process: Prompting
the user if necessary, moving the program if he or she chooses, relaunching the
program, and setting a default key so that the prompt is not repeated.
